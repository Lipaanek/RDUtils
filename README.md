# RDUtils
Roblox Dev Utils is library with various functions for roblox developers!

# How to use RDUtils?
RDUtils is split into five basic categories: MathUtils, AdvancedMathUtils, StringUtils, TableIT (also exists as seperate library) and MiscUtils.

## 1. MathUtils
MathUtils is library that takes most used functions and turns them into one **signle** function
>[!IMPORTANT]
>Many functions are missing or are under construction (for example logic gates).

### A. Clamp
```luau
MathUtils.Clamp(<Number>; <MinNumber>; <MaxNumber>)
```
Clamp is a mathematical function that checks if the number is in range within MinNumber and MaxNumber, if the number is smaller, then the number will be the smallest possible number in range and vice versa.

```
Number -> 11
MinNumber -> 1
MaxNumber -> 10

Output -> Number: 10
```

```
Number -> 0
MinNumber -> 1
MaxNumber -> 10

Output -> Number: 1
```

  ### How does it work?
  It uses very simple formula:
  ```luau
  math.max(MinNumber, math.min(MaxNumber, Number))
  ```
  `math.max` picks the biggest number in numbers that were given (for example if numbers were 1 and 5, it would return 5).
  `math.min` picks the smallest number in numbers that were given (for example if numbers were 1 and 5, it would return 1).
  What we are doing is picking the biggest number, but when we added `math.min` we are also checking if the set value is bigger or not, if yes it will return the smaller number. After that we have just `math.max` which picks the biggest number, if we consider `Number` is 11 then it will check if MinNumber is greater than Number. `math.min` returned us 10 and MinNumber is 1, then the whole code return the bigger number, in this case it's 10.

### B. Distance
```luau
MathUtils.Distance(<Pos1>; <Pos2>)
```
```luau
Pos1, Pos2 -> typeof("Vector3")
```
Distance function does what you should expect, it takes 2 Vector3 values `(Pos1 and Pos2)` and calculates distance between those 2 places.
```
Pos1 -> Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
Pos2 -> Vector3.new(0, 0, 0)

Output -> Distance: 10 studs
```
>[!NOTE]
>Distance is measured in `studs`.

  ### How does it work?
  It's suprisingly simple:
  ```luau
  (Pos1 - Pos2).Magnitude
  ```
  `.Magnitude` is build-in function that coverts Vector (distance) into number.
  We are subtracting 2 Vectors and after subtraction we are using build-in function called `.Magnitude`, we get number.

### C. Normalize Vector
```luau
MathUtils.VectorNormalize(Vector3)
```
This function Normalizes Vector to `Vector Unit`.
A `Unit Vector` is a Vector whoâ€™s values are based on 1. This is basically only used for directional vectors as far as I know[^1].

### D. Round
```luau
MathUtils.Round(<Number>; <Type>)
```
```
Type -> "Ceil"; "Floor"; "Round"
```
`Ceil` Rounds the number up regardles it's lower (ceil(1.1) -> 2).
`Floor` Rounds the number down regardles it's higher (floor(1.7) -> 1).
`Round` Rounds the number like normal (round(1.5) -> 2; round(1.4) -> 1)
